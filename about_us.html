        <h1>Welcome to The Bakery Around the Corner!</h1>
        <p>What started as a conversation between two friends quickly became The Bakery Around the Corner! We hope to make delicious treats that make you feel all the warm and fuzzies. While we only offer cupcakes for now, we're planning on extending our offerings in the future to include cakes, pies, and other delicious pastries!</p>
